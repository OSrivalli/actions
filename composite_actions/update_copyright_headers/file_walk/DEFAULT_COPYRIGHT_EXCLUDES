# DEFAULT DUMMY FILE
# This file allows you to specify files to exclude.
# It uses a CODEOWNERS-like syntax:
# https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners#example-of-a-codeowners-file

# Assigning any owner will cause the file to be excluded from copyright updates. Inversely, a file with no owner will be included.
# You can use the special fake '@include' user to override a previous rule and include a file.

# When using disclaimer-mode=config, only files with the '@disclaime' owner will get a disclaimer added
# When disclaime-mode=always or never, the '@disclaimer' owner is ignored: it is as if the file had no owner.
# Note that adding the '@disclaimer' does not exclude the file from copyright updates.

# EXAMPLE SYNTAX
# exclude_me/ @exclude
# exclude_me/include_me @include
# also_exclude_me/ @dummy
# *.js @exclude
# **/node_modules @exclude
# add_disclaimer/ @disclaimer
# add_disclaimer/exclude_me @exclude
# add_disclaimer/no_disclaimer @include

# --> All js files, all node_odules, all files in 'also_exclude_me/', and files in 'exclude_me' but not 'exclude_me/include_me' will be excluded.
# --> All files in add_disclaimer will get disclaimers added.
# Files in add_disclaimer/exclude_me will not get any updates
# FIles in add_disclaimer/no_disclaimer will get header updates, but no disclaimer.

# This default config excludes everything, so define your own !
